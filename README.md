# JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises

This repo was created to add the files created working and learning from the exercises on the [JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms + LEETCODE Exercises](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-structures-algorithms-javascript) course.

The course uses the JavaScript language as a basis. I'll be adding more languages to this repo as I find time.

## Languages

- [JavaScript](./javascript/)
- [Go](./go/)
